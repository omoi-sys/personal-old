        I'm currently a student in Oregon State University's Postbacc Computer Science program. This program is essentially a career changing program for individuals who already pocess a Bachelor's degree. My original training is in Physics, having received a B.S. from the California State University of Fresno.

        As of the creation of this simple website, I have completed 2 terms at OSU's Postbacc program and will complete the third one in mid Dec. 2019. So far I've completed an accelerated intro course to CS, taught in C++, a discrete math course, a computer architechture and assembly lang course, and will complete the data structures and web development courses this term.
